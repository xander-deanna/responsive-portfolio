Responsive-portfolio - Homework assignment for 01/02/2021

---------------------------------------------------------

This week's assignment was to create responsive portfolio closely mimiking the sample images provided. I decided to put my own creative spin on the assignment and play around with different colors and attributes while still meeting the requirements of the assignment.
